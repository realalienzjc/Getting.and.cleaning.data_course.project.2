2nd Course Project of 'Getting and Cleaning Data'
===


## Purposes

- To clean the raw files and make a tidy dataset for later processing

- To demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 


## General Description


According to the course project requirements, the run_analysis.R is supposed to do the following tasks right now:


	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set      
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.    
	5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


For information about the raw datasets, please also see the README file under the directory "UCI HAR Dataset"



## Files Layout

- UCI HAR Dataset and its subdirectory :   
raw data retrieved from link on course project page, <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> and unzipped

- run_analysis.R   
the processing script for generating the tidy datasets.

- README.md

- Codebook.md

- meansurements.mean.std.group.by.subject.activity.txt   
the tidy data generated by merging the train and the test datasets, then properly label the variables, extract the only measurement on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

- average.meansurements.group.by.subject.activity.txt    
the tidy data generated by averaging of each variable for each activity and each subject.
